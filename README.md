IMPORTANT:
- You will need to become a collaborator to see the project on the GitHub Website
- You will need to have UE5 installed on your device
- NEVER and I say NEVER touch the main branch in the project

For Designers:
How to set up GitHub repository (repo) on your device:

Best solution: GitHub Desktop:

1. Create GitHub account
  - notify me (Konrad) that you have created your account so I can add you as a collaborator
2. Download GitHub Desktop
3. Login with your credentials into GitHub Desktop
4. CLONE a repo from the internet
5. You should have a repo in the list visible as kmarcjanowicz/UE5_final_year_team_project
6. Choose a folder to download it to.
7. Click the file with .uproject extension to build it.

Good practise:
- if you want to make a change or you know that you will need to change anything in th eproject, create a different branch on Git(Hub)
- Make sure that meaningful commits have a date, title and a proper descrription of what is being changed
